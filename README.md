HireMate AI - AI-Powered Hiring Assistant ðŸ¤–
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
HireMate AI is an AI-powered hiring assistant chatbot designed to streamline the candidate screening process for recruiters and hiring managers. The chatbot interacts with candidates to:
âœ… Collect essential candidate details (name, experience, tech stack, etc.)
âœ… Generate technical interview questions tailored to the candidateâ€™s tech stack
âœ… Maintain a smooth, context-aware conversation
âœ… Enhance hiring efficiency using AI-driven insights

This chatbot is built using Streamlit for UI, OpenAI's GPT models for question generation, and Python for backend logic.

ðŸ”¹ Dependencies
streamlit â€“ For interactive UI
openai â€“ For generating AI-based technical questions
python-dotenv â€“ To securely store API keys
logging â€“ For debugging and monitoring
time â€“ To simulate real-time responses
To install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸ“Œ Prompt Design
The chatbot generates customized technical questions based on the candidate's tech stack.

ðŸ”¹ Prompt Logic
Extract Candidate's Tech Stack
Generate a Structured Prompt:

f"Generate 5 technical interview questions for a candidate proficient in {tech_stack}. 
Ensure the questions are relevant, practical, and well-balanced between basic, intermediate, and advanced levels."
Use OpenAI GPT to Generate Responses
Format Output as a Numbered List
ðŸ”¹ Edge Cases Handled
âœ… Empty Tech Stack â†’ Requests valid input
âœ… Multiple Technologies â†’ Balances questions across them
âœ… Uncommon Tech â†’ Generates related best-practice questions
âœ… Experience-Based Questions â†’ Adjusts difficulty level

ðŸ“Œ Challenges & Solutions
ðŸ”¹ Challenge 1: OpenAI API Deprecation Issues
Problem: openai.ChatCompletion.create() was deprecated in OpenAI v1.0.0+.
Solution: Used client.chat.completions.create() instead.
ðŸ”¹ Challenge 2: Handling Edge Cases in Inputs
Problem: Candidates might enter vague or incomplete tech stacks.
Solution: Added fallback mechanisms to refine user input.
ðŸ”¹ Challenge 3: Streamlit UI Enhancements
Problem: Needed a modern and interactive UI.
Solution: Used custom CSS styles and gradient buttons for an engaging user experience.
ðŸ”¹ Challenge 4: API Rate Limits
Problem: OpenAI API rate limits could cause delays.
Solution: Implemented error handling and retries for API failures.
ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
âœ… Integrate Resume Parsing to auto-extract tech stack
âœ… Deploy on Cloud (AWS/GCP) for live demo
âœ… Support Multilingual Chatbot
âœ… Enhance UI with Advanced Animations
