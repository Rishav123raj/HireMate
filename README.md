# HireMate AI - AI-Powered Hiring Assistant 🤖

## 📌 Project Overview

HireMate AI is an AI-powered hiring assistant chatbot designed to streamline the candidate screening process for recruiters and hiring managers. The chatbot interacts with candidates to:

- ✅ Collect essential candidate details (name, experience, tech stack, etc.)
- ✅ Generate technical interview questions tailored to the candidate’s tech stack
- ✅ Maintain a smooth, context-aware conversation
- ✅ Enhance hiring efficiency using AI-driven insights

This chatbot is built using **Streamlit** for UI, **OpenAI's GPT models** for question generation, and **Python** for backend logic.

## 📌 Technical Details

### 🔹 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for UI)
- **Backend**: Python
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Environment Management**: Virtual Environment (venv)
- **API Calls**: OpenAI API (`openai.ChatCompletion.create`)
- **Configuration**: `.env` file for API key security

### 🔹 File Structure

```plaintext
hiremate-ai/
│── images/                # Folder for storing UI images
│── app.py                 # Streamlit application (UI)
│── question_generator.py  # AI question generation logic
│── .env                   # API Key (hidden from GitHub)
│── requirements.txt       # Required dependencies
│── README.md              # Documentation
```

### 🔹 Dependencies

- `streamlit` – For interactive UI
- `openai` – For generating AI-based technical questions
- `python-dotenv` – To securely store API keys
- `logging` – For debugging and monitoring
- `time` – To simulate real-time responses

To install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📌 Prompt Design

The chatbot generates customized technical questions based on the candidate's tech stack.

### 🔹 Prompt Logic

1. Extract Candidate's Tech Stack
2. Generate a Structured Prompt:

```python
f"Generate 5 technical interview questions for a candidate proficient in {tech_stack}. Ensure the questions are relevant, practical, and well-balanced between basic, intermediate, and advanced levels."
```

3. Use OpenAI GPT to Generate Responses
4. Format Output as a Numbered List

### 🔹 Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ Empty Tech Stack → Requests valid input
- ✅ Multiple Technologies → Balances questions across them
- ✅ Uncommon Tech → Generates related best-practice questions
- ✅ Experience-Based Questions → Adjusts difficulty level

## 📌 Challenges & Solutions

### 🔹 Challenge 1: OpenAI API Deprecation Issues

**Problem:** `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` was deprecated in OpenAI v1.0.0+.

**Solution:** Used `client.chat.completions.create()` instead.

### 🔹 Challenge 2: Handling Edge Cases in Inputs

**Problem:** Candidates might enter vague or incomplete tech stacks.

**Solution:** Added fallback mechanisms to refine user input.

### 🔹 Challenge 3: Streamlit UI Enhancements

**Problem:** Needed a modern and interactive UI.

**Solution:** Used custom CSS styles and gradient buttons for an engaging user experience.

### 🔹 Challenge 4: API Rate Limits

**Problem:** OpenAI API rate limits could cause delays.

**Solution:** Implemented error handling and retries for API failures.
